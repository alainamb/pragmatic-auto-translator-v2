        "summary": "This seminal paper introduces the Transformer architecture, a novel neural network model that relies entirely on attention mechanisms for sequence transduction tasks, eliminating the need for recurrent or convolutional layers. The Transformer uses multi-head self-attention to process sequences in parallel, significantly improving training efficiency while achieving superior performance. On machine translation benchmarks, the model established new state-of-the-art results on WMT 2014 English-to-German (28.4 BLEU) and English-to-French (41.8 BLEU) translation tasks while requiring substantially less computational resources for training. The architecture consists of encoder and decoder stacks with multi-head attention, position-wise feed-forward networks, and positional encoding. Beyond translation, the paper demonstrates the Transformer's versatility by successfully applying it to English constituency parsing. This work fundamentally changed the landscape of natural language processing and became the foundation for subsequent breakthroughs in large language models.",

        "summary": "This paper critically examines the trend toward ever-larger language models in NLP, questioning whether “bigger is always better.” The authors identify four major areas of concern: (1) Environmental and financial costs - training large models produces substantial CO2 emissions and creates barriers to entry; (2) Unfathomable training data - massive internet-scraped datasets encode hegemonic viewpoints and biases that harm marginalized communities; (3) Misdirected research effort - focus on benchmark performance may not lead to genuine language understanding; and (4) Risk of harm - these models can generate seemingly coherent but biased or harmful text, which the authors term “stochastic parrots.” The paper argues that large language models manipulate linguistic form without true understanding, yet their fluent output can mislead users into attributing meaning and intent where none exists. This creates risks including reinforcement of stereotypes, generation of abusive content, and potential misuse by bad actors. The authors recommend shifting toward more careful data curation, stakeholder-centered design approaches, and research directions that prioritize understanding over scale, while considering the environmental and social costs of increasingly large models.",

It provides the first global standard-setting instrument on AI ethics, establishing a comprehensive framework of values, principles, and policy actions to guide the ethical development and deployment of AI systems throughout their lifecycle. The recommendation addresses AI ethics across UNESCO's core domains: education, science, culture, and communication/information. It emphasizes human rights, environmental protection, gender equality, and inclusive development, with particular attention to the needs of developing countries. The framework includes four foundational values (human rights and dignity, environmental flourishing, diversity and inclusiveness, and peaceful interconnected societies) and ten guiding principles covering areas such as proportionality, fairness, transparency, accountability, and human oversight. The document outlines eleven policy areas for implementation, including ethical impact assessment, governance frameworks, data policy, international cooperation, and sector-specific guidance for education, health, economy, and culture. It establishes mechanisms for monitoring and evaluation, and emphasizes the need for multi-stakeholder collaboration to ensure AI technologies serve humanity's benefit while preventing harm to individuals, societies, and ecosystems.",
